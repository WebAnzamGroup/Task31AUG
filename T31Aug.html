        <p>Customer service is one of the first and probably one of the most important parameters, which are usually evaluated by the company’s customers. Thus it is evident that there is a direct connection between customer service level and reputation of any company. “The experience that individuals have with a company and then what they hear from friends and family influence their perception of and likelhood to do busines with a company,” says Megan Burns, a senior analyst at Forrester research firm that specializes in customer service. It’s “absolutely an essential moment of truth for companies.” In order to reach the universally succesful characteristics of customer service – avalability and speed, it is necesary to implement various strategies.
        Certainly any company starts from its staff, to be more precise – from management staf. Tehere is no chances to avoided turnover, still there is a need to hiring profesional and devoted people, in order to guarante good customer service and overal success of a company. In order to introduce all the necessary changes and improvements into customer service – it is necessary to understand the needs of the actual and potential customers, taking into consieration each individual situation. There are various strategies for treating customers, for example clienttelling or service levels. Any type of customer services needs financial support, however, it is innportant not to waste money for hundreds of catalogues, which would be of litle use, rather to study the real needs and demands of the customers. Based on numerous new technologies there is a way to involve specially desinged software for making the process of comunication with customers easier and more advantageous.
        Finaly, one of the most important strategies is keeping in touch with your customers, especially in cases, when there were some problems, which you had to solve for them.
        Corporate reputation is without doubts vitally important for any operating company, because “It is the overall estimation in which an organiation is held by its internal and external stakeholders based on its past actions and probability of its future behavior.” Any professional company, providing services in such spheres as medicine, education, legal issues, would constantly control its reputation and factors, which are potentially able to influence it.  The relations between reputation and customer service go in two directions: on the one hand good reputation contributes to attraction of new customers and building competitive advantage, on the other hand it is not possible to develop good reputation without providing top-quality services to the customers and their satisfaction. Customers are able to influence each other, unfortunately this fact is not always thoroughly considered by managers, which might lead to lack of success in company’s operating. Experince is related to the past connmunication of a client with a company. Information could be gained from both past experience and actual communication either with representative of the company or with other customers. Reputation of a company should not be associated with well-organized communication process with its customers, rather it is a part of building of company’s identity.
        Overal, customer service is the key to building the reputation of any company, to promotion of its products and further development, whereas poorly built system of customer support might lead to leaving the business forever.</p>
